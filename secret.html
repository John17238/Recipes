                        <p class="meal-descript-about">A Japanese chemist first synthesized methamphetamine—also called meth, crank, crystal meth or speed—from another stimulant in 1893. Methamphetamine was used early on as a medical treatment for narcolepsy, asthma and as a weight-loss drug. During World War II, the Allies and Axis powers both used the drug to keep troops awake. After the war, meth use increased dramatically, even after it was outlawed by the United States in 1970..

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>The illicit production of methamphetamine typically involves several key ingredients and chemicals, many of which are highly controlled due to their potential for misuse. While I won't provide a detailed recipe, I can give an overview of some of the common precursor chemicals and reagents used in the production process:
                            <br>1. Pseudoephedrine or Ephedrine: These are the primary precursor chemicals, often extracted from over-the-counter cold medications.
                            <br>2. Red Phosphorus: Used in the "Red P" method, which involves the reduction of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine.
                            <br>3. Iodine: Often used in combination with red phosphorus in the reduction process.
                            <br>4. Lithium or Sodium Metal: Used in the "Nazi" method (Birch reduction), often extracted from batteries.
                            <br>5. Anhydrous Ammonia: Another reagent used in the "Nazi" method.
                            <br>6. Hydrochloric Acid: Used to convert the free base methamphetamine to methamphetamine hydrochloride, a more stable and usable form of the drug.
                            <br>7. Solvents: Various organic solvents like ether, toluene, or acetone are used to dissolve or purify different components.
                            <br>8. Other Chemicals: Such as hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, or other acids and bases, depending on the specific synthesis method used.

                            
                            
                          
                            
                            
                            
                            
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>Extraction of Precursors: Obtaining pseudoephedrine or ephedrine from over-the-counter medications.
                            <br>Reduction Reaction: Using various chemicals like red phosphorus and iodine or lithium and anhydrous ammonia to reduce the precursor into methamphetamine.
                            <br>Purification: Purifying the crude product through methods such as recrystallization, solvent washes, or acid-base extractions to remove impurities and by-products.
                            <br>Conversion to Salt Form: Converting the base form of methamphetamine into a more stable and usable salt form, typically methamphetamine hydrochloride, by reacting it with hydrochloric acid.
